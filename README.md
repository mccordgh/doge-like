# doge-like
Started out as a doggo rogue-like but might not end up that way who knows

Visual Studio 2019 is being used to develop this right now as the cross platforming stuff was just too complex on top of trying to learn c++ 

open the .sln in visual studio 2019 and enjoy (the game or more likely some errors :D)
