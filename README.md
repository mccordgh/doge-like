# doge-like
Started out as a doggo rogue-like but might not end up that way who knows

Visual Studio 2019 is being used to develop this right now as the cross platforming stuff was just too complex on top of trying to learn c++ 

open the .sln in visual studio 2019 and enjoy (the game or more likely some errors :D)

## Compiling
While I did have a way to compile on Linux, OS X, Windows via CMake, that is most likely broken at the moment since I swapped over to Visual Studio 2019 on windows for the time being.

Should be able to open the solution in Windows and compile via Visual Studio, but you need to install some SDL2 and SDL2_image packages via vcpkg.
