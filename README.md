# 2d_game_engine_sdl2_cpp

This is me attempting to make a 2d game engine in c++ leveraging all the awesomeness that is SDL2.

I'm was using XCode on a mac for this project...

But then I reconfigured it all in visual studio code now on Linux and soon windows/mac hoping to get some cross-platform compiling going :)
